## Useful Commands
These commands are designed for a wide range of commercial applications and allow users to utilize the drone for tasks such as inspection, delivery, and surveillance in various industries:

**Move Up / Move Down**: Vertical navigation for getting the drone to the required altitude.

**Pan Left / Pan Right**: Adjust the droneâ€™s orientation for full 360-degree coverage.

**Move Forward / Move Backward**: Basic forward or backward movement for navigating environments.

**Rotate Left / Rotate Right**: Rotate the drone to adjust the camera or sensors without changing position.

**Hover**: Stabilize the drone in one place for a detailed inspection or data capture.

**Track Object**: Automatically follow a moving object, such as a person or vehicle, based on real-time visual data.

**Follow Route**: Pre-program a route using GPS for the drone to follow autonomously.

**Survey Area**: Perform a comprehensive aerial survey, capturing images or video over a specified area.

**Inspect Structure**: Use the drone to fly close to buildings or infrastructure for inspections, such as roofs or tall structures.

**Scan Environment**: Utilize LiDAR and visual sensors to create a 3D model of the surrounding area for mapping or analysis.

**Search and Locate**: Activate a search mode to find and track specific objects or people, useful for search and rescue operations.

**Deliver Package**: Navigate to a specific location and release a payload (e.g., for delivery services or supply drops).

**Return to Home**: Command the drone to return to its controller automatically.

**Capture Data**: Record visual, thermal, or sensor data for later analysis or real-time transmission to the user.

**Patrol Area**: Perform repeated loops around a specified area, monitoring for changes or abnormalities.

**Thermal Scan**: Use thermal imaging to detect heat signatures, useful for energy audits or finding missing persons.

**Precise Landing**: Utilize sensors to guide the drone to a safe and accurate landing position.
